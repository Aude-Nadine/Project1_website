        The big question; When we cook our food, are we actually killing it?
        The idea is that by heating food, we are actually destroying its nutrients and natural enzymes.
        Some fans of raw food diets believe cooking makes food toxic and that by consuming it in its natural form,
        we are most likely to benefit from it more.
        Research has shown that a raw food diet can help eliminate illnesses through (a) the cleansing of the body,
        (b) boosting immunity and (c) by improving sleep and memory, increasing the bodies natural senergies on a massive scale.
